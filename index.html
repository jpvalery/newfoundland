				<p class="indent">We leave Montreal at noon and arrive in St. John’s a few hours later, smiling and eager to explore the eastern province. We have the simplest vehicle rental of our lives at the airport, carried out by a friendly staff. (Literally) 5 minutes later, we are ready to roam the roads of Newfoundland.</p>
				<p class="indent">For our first night, after supper, we drive around St. John’s in search of some nice spots to shoot. We find a lovely view on a lonely industrial pier. As we are near the end of the bay, the sounds of the city are muffled by the night air. The quiet is only troubled by small waves reaching the pier and the buzzing of electric street lights.</p>

				<p class="indent">That morning, we head to Cape Spear, Canada’s easternmost point of land. We find it closed, as the season has not yet begun. However, we can still walk around the site and enjoy the endless view of the Atlantic Ocean. The weather is foggy, but it gets clearer as we make our way back to the city.</p>

				<p class="indent">After a few other visits, we end the day at another famous St. John’s spot, Signal Hill. In addition to being the site of the city’s historical defenses, it is also where Marconi received the world’s first transatlantic wireless signal in 1901 (thus the name). The view is stunning. We spend a long time sitting on the side of the trail, enjoying the sun. It is about 12 degrees, which is a warm spring weather in Newfoundland. But our Canadian hearts know how to appreciate warmth, even when it is shy.</p>

Even though boarding a boat with 80 to 100 other tourists for a sightseeing tour might feel a bit tacky to you, we highly recommend you succumb to it.</p>

				<p class="indent">We see so many icebergs. Like frozen giants, they gently move with the waves, like old men in their favorite swinging chair. After the ice come the birds, thousands of them. There are puffins, but also common murres, storm petrels and gulls, flying around or nesting in the nearby islands. We sadly do not see any whales, but they aren’t back from migration yet. Iceberg season and whale season don’t always coincide in Newfoundland; it’s a risk you will have to take.</p>

				<p class="indent">Our main stop that day is the mystic Cape St. Mary’s Ecological Reserve. The reserve is well-known for its amazing bird watching experience. Between 60 000 and 70 000 thousand birds roam and nest around the Cape. This includes one of the largest northern gannets colony in North America.</p>

Though it is our second bird-watching experience in two days, this is something else.</p>

				<p class="indent">Our aim that day is to get to the Fogo Island ferry, but not without enjoying the sights along the way. After almost running over a coyote with suicidal tendencies in the middle of Terra Nova National Park, we make a detour by Twillingate. The region is famous for iceberg watching. Hundreds of ice monuments drift by its shores every spring and early summer, on their way to St. John's. We eventually finish our scenic loop through the area and reach Farewell, to catch the ferry.</p>

				<p class="indent">The next 24 hours on Fogo island are among our favorite of the trip. After diner at Scoff, a terrific restaurant in Joe Batt’s Arm, we catch a close-up view of the incredible Fogo Island Inn at sunset. This state-of-the-art sustainable hotel is a masterpiece of architecture. Perched on the rocky shore, its strange shape seems to challenge the ocean. Yet, it somehow fits, like in a curious harmony, with its surroundings. (Side note: it is incredibly expensive, so we did not spend the night there, but the hotel does welcome visitors to walk around and enjoy the sights). It is also a social enterprise that finances an art residencies program. Four artists studios, built by the same architect as the hotel, are “hidden” around the island. Their sight is a bit of a poetic surprise everytime we notice one of them.</p>

We continue exploring Fogo Island, going all the way to Tilting. Like many communities in Newfoundland, this fisherman village is of Irish descent. Historical wooden houses and boats bear witness to this particular past. </p>

				<p class="indent">Despite what the title of this website might have you think, we did stop a lot to look and to take photos. As you can see above, the inspiration came to us through a road panel in Gros-Morne, which urged drivers to look at wildlife but not to stop. We thought the phrasing of the panel, LOOK BUT NO STOPPING, in big bright letters, was kind of funny. And it also resonated in a way with the relatively fast-paced style of our road trip through Newfoundland..</p>

				<p class="indent">The Tablelands are the result of a billion-year-in-the-making geological phenomenon. Two continents collided and started bringing the Earth’s mantle to the surface, giving the place its red, almost barren appearance. We walk a short 4 km hike and behold the majestic landscape. Small trees and not-yet melted snow garnish the red and rocky soil. Some snow at the top of the "Tables", we are told, will remain year-round.</p>

				<p class="indent">On our way to St. Barbe, where we plan on taking the ferry to Labrador the next day, we spot our first moose (!) on the side of the road. Jp having spent most of his life in France, a moose is an exotic sighting. He was really crossing his fingers to see one (hopefully not one jumping on our car hood) during our trip. As for me, despite being Canadian, I had never seen a moose in the wild. So let’s just say we are both very excited by this encounter. We spend a long time observing the young cow and taking pictures. Unless she was the one observing us? For a short moment, time seems to suspend its run as we are mere feet away from the wild animal.</p>

				<p class="indent">At our arrival in St. Barbe, we learn that, due to poor weather, the ferry to Labrador did not run that day. Even though our tickets are for the next morning, it gets us thinking. Even if the ferry runs, it might not the following day. If this happens, it will be physically impossible to drive back to St John’s in time for our return flight. We can't afford to be stranded in Labrador. In the end, we elect to abort the crossing of the Strait of Belle-Isle, and to spend one more day in NL</p>

				<p class="indent">At our surprise, Botwood has a rich and passionating aeronautical past. For part of the 20th century, it has been with Gander a stop-and-refuel point for transatlantic flights. Artifacts and memorials attest of this history. The invention of more performing engines allowed for direct flights between Europe and North America biggest cities. This ultimately rendered the two airports almost obsolete. But not completely. Transatlantic flights still sign off today with Gander as they embark for the longest leg of their journey across the Atlantic North.</p>
